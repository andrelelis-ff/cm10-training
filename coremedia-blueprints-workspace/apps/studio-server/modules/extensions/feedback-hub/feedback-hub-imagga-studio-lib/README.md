#Imagga Connector for Feedback Hub

This extension implements the Feedback Hub's API to connect CoreMedia to the external systems `Imagga`, in order to provide keywords for selected content.

## Basic Setup

To activate this extension, you need to follow the documentation steps, described in the `Studio Development Manual`, under the section `Feedback Hub`. 

Assuming you have read the Feedback Hubs documentation and are familiar with the terminology of CoreMedia Feedback Hub, the next steps will shortly explain how to activate the `Imagga Adapter`:
 
- activate the `studio-server` extension with the extension tool
- provide a `settings document` to configure your `Imagga Adapter` as described in the documentation
- within your `Imagga` settings document you need to provide the value `imagga` for the key `factoryId` (The value must match the value, returned by the `ImaggaFeedbackHubAdapterFactory#getId` method)
- within your `Imagga` settings document you need to provide the following String values underneath the struct `settings`: 
    - `sourceBlobProperty`: the name of the blob property that stores a picture, that should be evaluated by Imagga
    - `basicAuthKey` : the authentication key, provided by Imagga after creating an account that allows using the API
