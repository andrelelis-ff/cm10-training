In a poll, nearly two-thirds of Houzzers say they would consider the dark alternative to shiny silver metal.”<br/></p><p><br/></p><p class="p--heading-2"><img alt="" xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:show="embed" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/Interior%20Design%20Article%20Folde6ea6d69f.xml#data" cmexport:path="/Sites/Aurora%20B2B%20Augmentation/United%20States/English/Editorial/Content/Decorating/Interior%20Design%20Article%20Folder/Outdoor%20Fabrics%20Indoors%20Image"/>Outdoor fabric used indoors</p><p>Outdoor fabrics are becoming increasingly hard to distinguish from traditional indoor fabrics.  According to <a xlink:href="http://www.houzz.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.houzz.com/</a>, “many Houzzers are bringing them inside, where their durability makes them perfect for high-traffic dining room and living room furniture.”<br/></p><p><br/></p><p class="p--heading-2"><img alt="" xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:show="embed" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/Interior%20Design%20Article%20Folde45f19af6.xml#data" cmexport:path="/Sites/Aurora%20B2B%20Augmentation/United%20States/English/Editorial/Content/Decorating/Interior%20Design%20Article%20Folder/Wrought%20Iron%20Outdoor%20Furniture%20Image"/>Black Metals</p><p>“There is nothing fussy about iron and blackened steel,” said Mr. Butera. No longer sidelined as the metal for overwrought outdoor furniture or bed frames, the decidedly unflashy material is appearing as simple hardware, bathroom fixtures and even flatware, said British interior designer Martyn Lawrence Bullard. Contemporary designers, such as Jasper Morrison blend it with wood and glass, or sometimes create entire pieces of matte black metal. “Welders are the new rock stars,” enthused New York designer Julia Haney-Montanez.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p class="p--heading-2"><img alt="" xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:show="embed" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/Interior%20Design%20Article%20Folde7d05e2f7.xml#data" cmexport:path="/Sites/Aurora%20B2B%20Augmentation/United%20States/English/Editorial/Content/Decorating/Interior%20Design%20Article%20Folder/Rounded%20Furniture%20Image"/>Rounded Furniture</p><p>“It started with the iPhone,” said New York designer Wesley Moon, who’s noting a curvy trickle-down aesthetic in home décor. English designer Rachel Laxer loves the execution of B&amp;B Italia’s Oskar table: “It’s a racetrack shape, almost a rectangle, with the sexiness of curves.” Radial and bullnose edges soften hard materials like marble, said Glenn Lawson of Lawson Fenning in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Los Angeles designer Timothy Corrigan asked, “Who doesn’t want to rub their hands along a smooth, rounded piece of marble? Touch is essential to design.”<br/></p><p><br/></p><p class="p--heading-2"><img alt="" xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:show="embed" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/Interior%20Design%20Article%20Folde3e95890b.xml#data" cmexport:path="/Sites/Aurora%20B2B%20Augmentation/United%20States/English/Editorial/Content/Decorating/Interior%20Design%20Article%20Folder/Old%20World%20Stove%20Image"/>Old-World Ornamentation</p><p>“People want the traditional and dressy, with a shot of nostalgia, to feel like everything is going to be OK,” said Tobi Fairley, based in Little Rock, Ark. In 2016, look for brocades, tapestries and Georgian and Empire antiques. Fringe, cording and tassels “soften the austerity of modern upholstery,” noted Kirill Istomin, who has offices in Moscow and New York. Expect, too, dramatic drapes. “Rooms without curtains are like a man in a suit without shoes,” said British designer Kathryn M. Ireland.</p></div></detailText>
