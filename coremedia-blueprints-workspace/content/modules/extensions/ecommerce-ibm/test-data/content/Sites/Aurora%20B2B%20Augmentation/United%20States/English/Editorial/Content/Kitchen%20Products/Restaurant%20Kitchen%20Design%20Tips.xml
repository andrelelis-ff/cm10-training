In this way, you will get timely information about the potential demands for changes in the kitchen design so that all requirements could be satisfied.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Design a flexible kitchen.</strong> Trends in cooking are changing and the need for menu changes in the future is something that can be realistically expected. But the inclusion of cooked dishes like soups and stews will require different equipment. Therefore, ensure that your kitchen is flexible and can respond to market demands in future.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Create working zones.</strong> Define the actions that will take place in the kitchen and create working zones: zone for food cleaning, cutting, baking, frying, cooking and others. With each employee working in his zone, unnecessary collision, tension, and chaos in the kitchen has been avoided.</li></ul><p> <a xlink:show="embed" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/Kitchen%20Teamwork%20Picture.xml" cmexport:path="/Sites/Aurora%20B2B%20Augmentation/United%20States/English/Editorial/Content/Kitchen%20Products/Kitchen%20Teamwork%20Picture">Kitchen Teamwork Picture</a></p><ul><li><strong>Store kitchen tools and appliances with similar functions together.</strong> Dishes and other equipment must have defined homes. They need to always return to the same predefined place.<br/><br/><a xlink:show="embed" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="coremedia:///cap/resources/Clean%20Kitchen%20Picture.xml" cmexport:path="/Sites/Aurora%20B2B%20Augmentation/United%20States/English/Editorial/Content/Kitchen%20Products/Clean%20Kitchen%20Picture">Clean Kitchen Picture</a></li><li><strong>Keep away tables with the cooling system</strong> for the preparation of meat and other foods that require low temperatures during the preparation from electric cookers and ovens. Also, all refrigerators and ice makers should be as far as possible from equipment for cooking and baking. This provides minimal energy consumption and safety for processed foods.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>When choosing electrical appliances pay special attention to energy consumption</strong> for each of them. The high cost of electric appliances with low energy consumption are cost effective in the long term.<br/> </li><li><strong>You should never buy equipment that does not have specialized service for the repair or replacement of parts in the vicinity of your restaurant.</strong><br/></li></ul><p>Cooking at home for yourself, your family and friends without the time frame is something that you may really enjoy. Cooking in a restaurant is something different and it is often a very stressful job, but it does not have to be like that.</p></div></detailText>
